# AchievementHunter
This is a simple code that uses BeautifulSoup to parse your achievements from Steam, and uses openpyxl to write to an excel written to your documents file (you can change this file name and path of course

# How this code works?
First, before you run, make sure your steam profile is public. As mentioned, this code uses BeautifulSoup to scape the website of your achievements profile, so your profile will need to be public in order for this code to work.

How it works:
1) Run the script
2) Enter your steam id (not the name on your profile but your actual steam id or custom steam id)
3) Enter the game you're searching for
    --> you will get a list of games
    --> you DO NOT have to complete the search. For example, if I want to search for the game "Dead by Daylight", I can type "dead by da" and still get it to appear at the top of my search results or pretty close to it

4) Once you select which game you're searching for, you won't need to type anything else. The excel file and sheet have been made

# Data collection
Jk this code does not collect data
